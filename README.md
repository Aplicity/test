# Mainstream classification model comparison

## Main process
* Manually build three models of KNN, Naive Bayes, and Perceptron. Perceptron is a BP neural network based on tensor flow
* Call the sklearn library to build two models of decision tree and SVM.
* Compare and evaluate the above five models. The evaluation refers to the accuracy, ROC curve, and AUC.

## used library
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn
* tensorflow
* matplotlib

## File Description
* source.ipynb: source code, please open with jupyter notebook
* images: ROC graph storage directory generated by model evaluation
* dataset.php.xlsx: data file

## Instructions for use
The data is read first, the last column of the data is label, and the rest is training input. Since the input data is -1, 0, 1. Data prediction processing is no longer performed here. The training input is represented by X, and y is the label. The following is an exemplary operation for the use of each model.

* KNN (similar to the operation of calling the sklearn model)

Knn = KNN(n_neighbors=10)
Y_proba = knn.predict_proba(X)
Y_pred = knn.predict(X)

* Perceptron

This model is not decorated as a class, or even written as a function, so you need to run the code completely. In the code interpretation, the #Parameter part is the parameter of the model, which can be adjusted according to actual needs.

* Naïve Bayes (similar to the operation of calling the sklearn model)

Clf = NaiveBayesBase()
Clf.fit(X,y)
Y_pred = clf.predict(X)

* Decision Tree

The model in sklearn.
Clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=6)
Clf.fit(X,y)
Y_proba = clf.predict_proba(X)

* RBF SVM

The model in sklearn.
Clf = SVC(probability=True)
Clf.fit(X,y)
Y_proba = clf.predict_proba(X)
Y_pred = clf.predict(X)
